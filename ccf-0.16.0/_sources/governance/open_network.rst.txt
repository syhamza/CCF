Opening a Network
=================

This sections assumes that a set of nodes has already been started by :term:`Operators`. See :doc:`/operations/start_network`.


Adding Users
------------

Once a CCF network is successfully started and an acceptable number of nodes have joined, members should vote to open the network to :term:`Users`. First, :doc:`the identities of trusted users should be generated </use_apps/index>`.

Then, the certificates of trusted users should be registered in CCF via the member governance interface. For example, the first member may decide to make a proposal to add a new user (here, ``user_cert`` is the PEM certificate of the user -- see :ref:`overview/cryptography:Cryptography` for a list of supported algorithms):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat add_user.json
    {
        "parameter": [<cert of proposed new user>],
        "script": {
            "text": "tables, user_cert = ...; return Calls:call(\"new_user\", user_cert)"
    }

    $ scurl.sh https://<ccf-node-address>/gov/proposals --cacert network_cert --key member0_privk --cert member0_cert --data-binary @add_user.json -H "content-type: application/json"
    {
        "proposal_id": 5,
        "proposer_id": 0,
        "state": "OPEN"
    }

Other members are then allowed to vote for the proposal, using the proposal id returned to the proposer member (here ``5``). They may submit an unconditional approval, or their vote may query the current state and the proposed actions. These votes `must` be signed.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat vote_accept.json
    {
        "ballot": {
            "text": "return true"
        }
    }

    $ scurl.sh https://<ccf-node-address>/gov/proposals/5/votes --cacert network_cert --key member1_privk --cert member1_cert --data-binary @vote_accept.json -H "content-type: application/json"
    {
        "proposal_id": 5,
        "proposer_id": 0,
        "state": "OPEN"
    }

    $ cat vote_conditional.json
    {
        "ballot": {
            "text": "tables, calls = ...; return (#calls == 1 and calls[1].func == \"new_user\")"
        }
    }

    $ scurl.sh https://<ccf-node-address>/gov/proposals/5/votes --cacert network_cert --key member2_privk --cert member2_cert --data-binary @vote_conditional.json -H "content-type: application/json"
    {
        "proposal_id": 5,
        "proposer_id": 0,
        "state": "ACCEPTED"
    }

The user is successfully added once a the proposal has received enough votes under the rules of the :term:`Constitution` (indicated by the response body showing a transition to state ``ACCEPTED``).

The user can then make user RPCs, for example ``user_id`` to retrieve the unique caller ID assigned to them by CCF:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl https://<ccf-node-address>/app/user_id --cacert network_cert --key new_user_privk --cert new_user_cert
    {
        "caller_id": 4
    }

User Data
---------

For each user, CCF also stores arbitrary user-data in a JSON object. This can only be written to by members, subject to the standard proposal-vote governance mechanism, via the ``set_user_data`` action. This lets members define initial metadata for certain users; for example to grant specific privileges, associate a human-readable name, or categorise the users. This user-data can then be read (but not written) by user-facing endpoints.

For example, the ``/log/private/admin_only`` endpoint in the C++ logging sample app uses user-data to restrict who is permitted to call it:

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: user_data_check
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: user_data_check
    :dedent: 12

Members configure this permission with ``set_user_data`` proposals:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat set_user_data_proposal.json
    {
        "script": {
            "text": "tables, args = ...; return Calls:call(\"set_user_data\", args)"
        },
        "parameter": {
            "user_id": 0,
            "user_data": {
                "isAdmin": true
            }
        }
    }

Once this proposal is accepted, user 0 is able to use this endpoint:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl https://<ccf-node-address>/app/log/private/admin_only --key user0_privk.pem --cert user0_cert.pem --cacert networkcert.pem -X POST --data-binary '{"id": 42, "msg": "hello world"}' -H "Content-type: application/json" -i
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    true

All other users have empty or non-matching user-data, so will receive a HTTP error if they attempt to access it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl https://<ccf-node-address>/app/log/private/admin_only --key user1_privk.pem --cert user1_cert.pem --cacert networkcert.pem -X POST --data-binary '{"id": 42, "msg": "hello world"}' -H "Content-type: application/json" -i
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

    Only admins may access this endpoint

Opening the Network
-------------------

Once users are added to the opening network, members should create a proposal to open the network:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat open_network.json
    {
        "script": {
            "text": "return Calls:call(\"open_network\")"
        }
    }

    $ scurl.sh https://<ccf-node-address>/gov/proposals --cacert network_cert --key member0_privk --cert member0_cert --data-binary @open_network.json -H "content-type: application/json"
    {
        "proposal_id": 10,
        "proposer_id": 0,
        "state": "OPEN"
    }

Other members are then able to vote for the proposal using the returned proposal id (here ``10``).

Once the proposal has received enough votes under the rules of the :term:`Constitution` (``"result":true``), the network is opened to users. It is only then that users are able to execute transactions on the business logic defined by the enclave file (``--enclave-file`` option to ``cchost``).
