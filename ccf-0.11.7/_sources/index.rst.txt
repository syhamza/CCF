The Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF) is an open-source framework for building a new category of secure, highly available,
and performant applications that focus on multi-party compute and data.
CCF can enable high-scale, confidential networks that meet key enterprise requirements
â€” providing a means to accelerate production and enterprise adoption of consortium based blockchain and multi-party compute technology.

Leveraging the power of trusted execution environments (TEEs), decentralized systems concepts, and cryptography, CCF enables enterprise-ready multiparty computation or blockchains.
