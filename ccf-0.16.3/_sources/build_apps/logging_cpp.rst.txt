Logging (C++)
=============

A C++ application exposes itself to CCF by implementing:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/enclave/app_interface.h
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: rpc_handler
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: rpc_handler
    :dedent: 2

The Logging application simply has:

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: rpc_handler
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: rpc_handler
    :dedent: 2

.. note::

    :cpp:class:`kv::Store` tables are essentially the only interface between CCF
    and the application, and the sole mechanism for it to have state.

    The Logging application keeps its state in a pair of tables, one containing private encrypted logs and the other containing public unencrypted logs. Their type is defined as:

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
        :language: cpp
        :start-after: SNIPPET: table_definition
        :lines: 1
        :dedent: 2

    Table creation happens in the app's constructor:

    .. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
        :language: cpp
        :start-after: SNIPPET_START: constructor
        :end-before: SNIPPET_END: constructor
        :dedent: 4

RPC Handler
-----------

The type returned by :cpp:func:`ccfapp::get_rpc_handler()` should subclass :cpp:class:`ccf::UserRpcFrontend`, passing the base constructor a reference to an implementation of :cpp:class:`ccf::EndpointRegistry`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET: inherit_frontend
    :lines: 1
    :dedent: 2

The logging app defines :cpp:class:`ccfapp::LoggerHandlers`, which creates and installs handler functions or lambdas for several different HTTP endpoints. Each of these functions takes as input the details of the current request (such as the URI which was called, the query string, the request body), interacts with the KV tables using the given :cpp:class:`kv::Tx` object, and returns a result:

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: record
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: record
    :dedent: 6

This example uses the ``json_adapter`` wrapper function, which handles parsing of a JSON params object from the HTTP request body.

Each function is installed as the handler for a specific HTTP resource, defined by a verb and URI:

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: install_record
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: install_record
    :dedent: 6

This example installs at ``"log/private", HTTP_POST``, so will be invoked for HTTP requests beginning ``POST /app/log/private``.

The return value from ``make_endpoint`` is an ``Endpoint&`` object which can be used to alter how the handler is executed. For example, the handler for ``/log/private`` shown above sets a `schema` declaring the types of its request and response bodies. These will be used in calls to the ``/api`` endpoint to populate the relevant parts of the OpenAPI document. There are other endpoints installed for the URI path ``/log/private`` with different verbs, to handle ``GET`` and ``DELETE`` requests. Any other verbs, without an installed endpoint, will not be accepted - the framework will return a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` response.

To process the raw body directly, a handler should use the general lambda signature which takes a single ``EndpointContext&`` parameter. Examples of this are also included in the logging sample app. For instance the ``log_record_text`` handler takes a raw string as the request body:

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: log_record_text
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: log_record_text
    :dedent: 6

Rather than parsing the request body as JSON and extracting the message from it, in this case `the entire body` is the message to be logged, and the ID to associate it with is passed as a request header. This requires some additional code in the handler, but provides complete control of the request and response formats.

This general signature also allows a handler to see additional caller context. An example of this is the ``log_record_prefix_cert`` handler:

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: log_record_prefix_cert
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: log_record_prefix_cert
    :dedent: 6

This uses mbedtls to parse the caller's TLS certificate, and prefixes the logged message with the ``Subject`` field extracted from this certificate.

If a handler makes no writes to the KV, it may be installed as read-only:

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: install_get
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: install_get
    :dedent: 6

This offers some additional type safety (accidental `put`\s or `remove`\s will be caught at compile-time) and also enables performance scaling since read-only operations can be executed on any receiving node, whereas writes must always be executed on the primary node.

API Schema
~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of taking and returning `nlohmann::json` objects directly, the endpoint handlers use a macro-generated schema and parser converting compliant requests into a PoD C++ object:

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging_schema.h
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: macro_validation_macros
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: macro_validation_macros
    :dedent: 2

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/apps/logging/logging.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: macro_validation_record
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: macro_validation_record
    :dedent: 6

This produces validation error messages with a low performance overhead, and ensures the schema and parsing logic stay in sync, but is only suitable for simple schema - an object with some required and some optional fields, each of a supported type.
