Joining from Snapshot
=====================

.. warning:: The snapshotting feature was introduced in CCF 0.13 and is currently experimental.

When a node has successfully joined a network, the entire transaction history is automatically replicated to this new node. Depending on the number of historical transactions, this process can take some non-negligible period of time, preventing the new node to quickly take part in the consensus.

To avoid this, it is possible for a new node to join from an existing snapshot of the recent CCF state. In this case, only historical transactions between the version at which the snasphot was taken and the current state will be replicated.

Snapshots are generated at regular intervals by the current primary node and stored under the directory specified via the ``--snapshot-dir`` CLI option (defaults to ``snapshots/``). The transaction interval at which snapshots are generated is specified via the ``--snapshot-tx-interval`` CLI option (defaults to no snapshot).

.. note:: Because the generation of a snapshot :ref:`requires a new ledger chunk to be created <audit/ledger:File Layout>` , all nodes in the network must be started with the same ``--snapshot-tx-interval`` value.

Once a snapshot has been generated by the primary, operators can copy  or mount the snapshot directory to the new node directory before it is started. On start-up, the new node will automatically resume from the latest available snapshot file in the ``--snapshot-dir`` directory. If no snapshot file is found, all historical transactions will be replicated to that node.

.. note:: Nodes that started from a snapshot can still process historical queries if the historical ledger (i.e. the ledger files preceding the snapshot) is made accessible to the node via the ``--read-only-ledger-dir`` option. Although the read-only ledger directory must be specified to the node on start-up, the historical ledger files can be copied to this directory `after` the node is started.
