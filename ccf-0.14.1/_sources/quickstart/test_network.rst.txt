Starting a Test Network
=======================

.. note:: Before starting a CCF test network, make sure that:

    - The CCF runtime environment has successfully been setup (see :ref:`environment setup instructions <quickstart/run_setup:Setup CCF Runtime Environment>`).
    - CCF is installed (see :ref:`installation steps <quickstart/install:Install>`)

The quickest way to start a CCF test network is to use the `start_test_network.sh <https://github.com/microsoft/CCF/blob/master/start_test_network.sh>`_ test script, specifying the :doc:`enclave image </developers/index>` to run.

The script creates a new test CCF network composed of 3 nodes running locally. All the governance requests required to open the network to users are automatically issued.

For example, deploying the ``liblogging`` example application:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd CCF/build
    $ ../start_test_network.sh --package ./liblogging.enclave.so.signed
    Setting up Python environment...
    Python environment successfully setup
    [14:47:41.562] Starting 3 CCF nodes...
    [14:48:12.138] Started CCF network with the following nodes:
    [14:48:12.138]   Node [ 0] = 127.177.10.108:37765
    [14:48:12.138]   Node [ 1] = 127.169.74.37:58343
    [14:48:12.138]   Node [ 2] = 127.131.108.179:50532
    [14:48:12.138] You can now issue business transactions to the ./liblogging.enclave.so.signed application.
    [14:48:12.138] Keys and certificates have been copied to the common folder: /path/to/test_network_common
    [14:48:12.138] See https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/master/users/issue_commands.html for more information.
    [14:48:12.138] Press Ctrl+C to shutdown the network.

.. note::

    - To use CCF `virtual` mode, the same command can be run with ``TEST_ENCLAVE=virtual`` set as environment variable and the virtual version of the enclave application passed to the script. For example ``$ TEST_ENCLAVE=virtual ../start_test_network.sh --package ./liblogging.virtual.so``.
    - The ``--verbose`` argument can be used to display all commands issued by operators and members to start the network.
    - Snapshots can be generated at regular intervals by the primary node of the service using the ``--snapshot-tx-interval <interval>`` option.

The log files (``out`` and ``err``) and ledger directory (``<node_id>.ledger``) for each CCF node can be found under ``./workspace/test_network_<node_id>``.

.. note:: The first time the command is run, a Python virtual environment will be created. This may take a few seconds. It will not be run the next time the ``start_test_network.sh`` script is started.

In a different terminal, using the local IP address and port of the CCF nodes displayed by the command (e.g. ``https://127.177.10.108:37765`` for node ``0``), it is then possible for users to :ref:`issue business requests <users/issue_commands:Issuing Commands>`.

Recovering a Service
--------------------

The ``start_test_network.sh`` script can also be used to automatically recover a defunct network, as per the steps described :ref:`here <members/accept_recovery:Accepting Recovery and Submitting Shares>`. The ledger to be recovered (``--ledger-dir``) , the defunct network encryption public key (``--network-enc-pubk``) and the directory containing the members and users identities and the network encryption public key (``--common-dir``) should be passed as arguments to the script.

Additionally, if snapshots were generated by the defunct service (using the ``--snapshot-tx-interval <interval>`` option), the recovery procedure can be significantly speeded up by re-starting from the latest available snapshot (``--snapshot-dir``).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd CCF/build
    $ cp -r ./workspace/test_network_0/0.ledger .
    $ cp -r ./workspace/test_network_0/snapshots . # Optional, only if snapshots are available
    $ cp ./workspace/test_network_0/network_enc_pubk.pem .
    $ ../start_test_network.sh -p liblogging.enclave.so.signed --recover --ledger-dir 0.ledger --network-enc-pubk network_enc_pubk.pem --common-dir ./workspace/test_network_common/ [--snapshot-dir snapshots]
    [14:50:19.746] Starting 3 CCF nodes...
    [14:50:19.746] Recovering network from:
    [14:50:19.746]  - Defunct network public encryption key: network_enc_pubk.pem
    [14:50:19.746]  - Common directory: ./workspace/test_network_common/
    [14:50:19.746]  - Ledger: 0.ledger
    [14:50:24.388] Started CCF network with the following nodes:
    [14:50:24.388]   Node [ 3] = 127.191.152.111:40371
    [14:50:24.388]   Node [ 4] = 127.184.250.157:35113
    [14:50:24.388]   Node [ 5] = 127.175.51.36:34699
    [14:50:24.388] You can now issue business transactions to the liblogging.enclave.so.signed application.
    [14:50:24.388] Keys and certificates have been copied to the common folder: /path/to/test_network_common
    [14:50:24.388] See https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/master/users/issue_commands.html for more information.
    [14:50:24.388] Press Ctrl+C to shutdown the network.

The effects of transactions committed by the defunct network should then be recovered. Users can also :ref:`issue new business requests <users/issue_commands:Issuing Commands>`.

.. note:: The ``--ledger-recovery-timeout`` argument should be used to specify the maximum timeout (in seconds) that the script will wait for CCF to recover the ledger. Depending on the size of the ledger to recover, this timeout may have to be set to a large value.
