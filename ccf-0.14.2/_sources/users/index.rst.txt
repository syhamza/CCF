To generate the certificate and private key of trusted users should be generated as follows. For example, for one user:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ keygenerator.sh --name user1
    -- Generating identity private key and certificate for participant "user1"...
    Identity private key generated at:   user1_privk.pem
    Identity certificate generated at:   user1_cert.pem (to be registered in CCF)

.. note:: The ``keygenerator.sh`` script is installed as part of the :ref:`CCF Python package <users/python_tutorial:Python Client Tutorial>` or can be found in the CCF repo under ``python/utils``. This is a simple wrapper around openssl. CCF will accept key may generated by other tools, as long as they are in the correct format and on a supported cryptographic curve. See :ref:`design/cryptography:Algorithms and Curves` for the list of supported cryptographic curves.

Before issuing business transactions to CCF, the certificates of trusted users need to be voted in by the consortium of members (see :ref:`members/open_network:Adding Users`).
